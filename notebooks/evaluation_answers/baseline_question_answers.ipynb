    "\n",
    "**Question:** What are the top 3 cybersecurity risks mentioned across all financial services companies in their 2024 10-K filings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Based on analysis of JPMorgan Chase, Visa, and Bank of America 2024 10-K filings, the top 3 cybersecurity risks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Third-Party and Supply Chain Cybersecurity Dependencies\n",
    "All three companies identified reliance on third-party vendors, service providers, and the interconnected financial ecosystem as a critical cybersecurity risk. This includes cloud providers, payment processors, clearing houses, financial data aggregators, and technology vendors with varying levels of security capabilities. Companies have limited control over third-party security practices, and a breach at one vendor can cascade across multiple institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. AI-Powered and Rapidly Evolving Cyber Threats\n",
    "All three companies highlighted the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks driven by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and emerging technologies. Threat actors are using generative AI to create advanced phishing attacks, deepfakes, and social engineering schemes. Additionally, quantum computing poses future threats to encryption. These techniques evolve rapidly, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against all threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ransomware and Extortion Attacks\n",
    "All three companies explicitly mentioned ransomware as a major threat, involving malicious code that encrypts systems and demands payment. These attacks can result in operational disruptions, data loss, financial extortion, and inability to serve customers. Ransomware is often combined with data theft for additional leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Honorable Mention:** Interconnected financial system vulnerabilities (systemic risk where one institution's breach can trigger industry-wide disruptions) was mentioned by all three companies but is closely related to the third-party risk theme.\n",

   "source": "## Question 5: Tech Companies - R&D Spending vs Profit Margins (2024)\n\n**Question:** Based on 2024 10-K filings, which tech companies reported both increased R&D spending AND declining profit margins? Explain the relationship.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nBased on analysis of 8 major tech companies' 2024 10-K filings, **only 3 companies** reported both increased R&D spending AND declining profit margins:\n\n1. **Tesla, Inc.** - R&D increased 14.4% while all margins declined (gross -0.3%, operating -2.0%, net -8.2%)\n2. **Apple Inc.** - R&D increased 4.9% while net margin declined -1.3% (caveat: operational margins improved; decline driven by $10.2B one-time EU tax charge)\n3. **Intel Corporation** - R&D increased 3.1% while all margins collapsed catastrophically (gross -7.3%, operating -22.2%, net -39.3%; posted $19.2B loss)\n\n**The Relationship:**\n\n**The Traditional View (R&D spending pressures margins) applied to only 2 companies:**\n\n- **Tesla:** Increased R&D investment in new models and manufacturing while facing pricing pressure from EV competition and slower revenue growth (+0.9%), resulting in compressed margins across all levels. The net margin decline was severe (-8.2 points), driven by both operational pressures and the absence of a prior-year \\$5B tax benefit.\n\n- **Intel:** Catastrophic case where massive R&D investment (\\$16.5B, highest in absolute dollars) failed to prevent competitive erosion. Revenue declined 2.1% while costs increased 10.0%, creating a perfect storm. Intel lost ground to NVIDIA in AI chips and AMD in CPUs, leading to a \\$19.2B loss and restructuring charges of \\$7.0B.\n\n**The Modern Reality (6 out of 8 companies): Strong operational leverage allows R&D investment while expanding margins:**\n\n- **Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, NVIDIA** all increased R&D spending while improving all profit margins through:\n  - Revenue growth outpacing cost growth\n  - Platform economics and scale advantages\n  - High-margin AI/cloud products\n  - Operational efficiency improvements\n\n- **NVIDIA** demonstrated the most dramatic operational leverage: revenue more than doubled (+114%), R&D increased 49%, yet operating margin expanded +8.3 points and net margin +7.1 points, driven by high-margin AI GPU demand (H100, H200).\n\n- **Meta** showed the strongest margin expansion: operating margin +7.5 points, net margin +8.9 points, reflecting the success of their 2023 \"Year of Efficiency\" initiatives combined with strong advertising revenue growth.\n\n**Key Insight:** The relationship between R&D spending and profit margins is **not deterministic**. In 2024, successful tech companies demonstrated that increased R&D investment can coincide with margin expansion when driven by strong revenue growth, operational efficiency, and high-margin product portfolios. The companies experiencing margin pressure (Tesla, Intel) faced fundamental business challenges: competitive pricing pressure (Tesla) and market share loss (Intel), not simply R&D investment levels.\n\n**Apple is a special case:** While technically meeting the criteria due to net margin decline, the decline was entirely attributable to a one-time $10.2B tax charge from the EU State Aid case. Operationally, Apple improved gross margin (+2.1%) and operating margin (+1.7%) despite increased R&D, demonstrating strong operational performance.\n\n**Important Definitions:**\n\n- **Gross Profit** = Revenue - Cost of Revenue (dollar amount shown in 10-K)\n- **Gross Margin** = Gross Profit / Revenue × 100% (percentage we calculate)\n- **Operating Profit** = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses (dollar amount shown in 10-K as \"Income from operations\")\n- **Operating Margin** = Operating Profit / Revenue × 100% (percentage we calculate)\n- **Net Profit** = Net Income (dollar amount shown in 10-K)\n- **Net Profit Margin** = Net Income / Revenue × 100% (percentage we calculate)\n\n**Why use margins (percentages) instead of profit (dollars)?**\n- Margins show profitability efficiency per dollar of revenue\n- Accounts for revenue changes between years\n- Better for comparing performance across different-sized companies or time periods\n\n---\n\n### Company Analysis\n\n#### Tesla, Inc.\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** January 30, 2025\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended December 31, 2024\n- **CIK:** 0001318605\n- **Location:** Item 8 - Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Total revenues | $97,690 | $96,773 | +$917 (+0.9%) |\n| Cost of revenues | $80,240 | $79,113 | +$1,127 (+1.4%) |\n| Gross profit | $17,450 | $17,660 | -$210 (-1.2%) |\n| R&D expense | $4,540 | $3,969 | +$571 (+14.4%) |\n| Operating income | $7,076 | $8,891 | -$1,815 (-20.4%) |\n| Net income | $7,091 | $14,997 | -$7,906 (-52.7%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 17.9% | 18.2% | -0.3% |\n| Operating margin | 7.2% | 9.2% | -2.0% |\n| Net profit margin | 7.3% | 15.5% | -8.2% |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ✅ **YES**\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 14.4% ($571M)\n- ✅ All profit margins declined:\n  - Gross margin: -0.3%\n  - Operating margin: -2.0%\n  - Net margin: -8.2% (most significant decline)\n\n**Analysis:**\nTesla increased R&D spending significantly while experiencing declining profitability across all margin types. The net profit margin decline was particularly severe (-8.2 percentage points), driven by both lower operating margins and tax impacts (2023 had a \\$5B tax benefit that didn't recur in 2024).\n\n---\n\n#### Apple Inc.\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** November 1, 2024\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended September 28, 2024\n- **CIK:** 0000320193\n- **Location:** Item 8 - Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Total net sales | $391,035 | $383,285 | +$7,750 (+2.0%) |\n| Total cost of sales | $210,352 | $214,137 | -$3,785 (-1.8%) |\n| Gross margin | $180,683 | $169,148 | +$11,535 (+6.8%) |\n| R&D expense | $31,370 | $29,915 | +$1,455 (+4.9%) |\n| Operating income | $123,216 | $114,301 | +$8,915 (+7.8%) |\n| Net income | $93,736 | $96,995 | -$3,259 (-3.4%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 46.2% | 44.1% | +2.1% (improved) |\n| Operating margin | 31.5% | 29.8% | +1.7% (improved) |\n| Net profit margin | 24.0% | 25.3% | -1.3% (declined) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ✅ **YES** (with caveat)\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 4.9% ($1,455M)\n- ✅ Net profit margin declined by 1.3%\n- ⚠️ **NOTE:** Gross margin and operating margin both IMPROVED\n  - Gross margin: +2.1%\n  - Operating margin: +1.7%\n\n**Analysis:**\nApple increased R&D spending while experiencing a decline in net profit margin. However, the company's operational performance actually improved, with both gross and operating margins increasing. The net margin decline was primarily driven by a $10.2 billion one-time income tax charge related to the European Commission State Aid Decision (Ireland tax case settled in Q4 2024). Without this tax charge, Apple's net margin would have improved along with gross and operating margins.\n\n**Key Insight:** Apple's profitability at the operational level (gross and operating) improved despite higher R&D spending, demonstrating strong operational efficiency. The net margin decline is a one-time tax event, not a structural profitability issue.\n\n---\n\n#### Microsoft Corporation\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** July 30, 2024\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended June 30, 2024\n- **CIK:** 0000789019\n- **Location:** Item 8 - Consolidated Statements of Operations (Income Statements)\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Total revenue | $245,122 | $211,915 | +$33,207 (+15.7%) |\n| Total cost of revenue | $74,114 | $65,863 | +$8,251 (+12.5%) |\n| Gross margin | $171,008 | $146,052 | +$24,956 (+17.1%) |\n| R&D expense | $29,510 | $27,195 | +$2,315 (+8.5%) |\n| Operating income | $109,433 | $88,523 | +$20,910 (+23.6%) |\n| Net income | $88,136 | $72,361 | +$15,775 (+21.8%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 69.8% | 68.9% | +0.9% (improved) |\n| Operating margin | 44.6% | 41.8% | +2.8% (improved) |\n| Net profit margin | 36.0% | 34.1% | +1.9% (improved) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ❌ **NO**\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 8.5% ($2,315M)\n- ❌ All profit margins IMPROVED:\n  - Gross margin: +0.9%\n  - Operating margin: +2.8%\n  - Net profit margin: +1.9%\n\n**Analysis:**\nMicrosoft increased R&D spending by 8.5% while simultaneously improving all profit margins. The company demonstrated exceptional operational leverage, with revenue growing 15.7% - faster than both cost of revenue (+12.5%) and R&D expense (+8.5%). This resulted in expanding margins across the board, with operating margin improving the most (+2.8 percentage points).\n\n**Key Insight:** Microsoft represents the opposite pattern from Tesla - strong revenue growth and operational efficiency allowed the company to invest more in R&D while expanding profitability. This demonstrates successful scaling of their cloud and AI businesses (Azure, Microsoft 365, etc.) with improving unit economics.\n\n---\n\n#### Alphabet Inc. (Google)\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** January 30, 2024\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended December 31, 2023\n- **CIK:** 0001652044\n- **Location:** Item 8 - Consolidated Statements of Income\n- **Note:** This is the 2023 10-K (contains 2022-2023 data), not 2024 10-K (which would contain 2023-2024 data and typically files in early 2025)\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Total revenues | $307,394 | $282,836 | +$24,558 (+8.7%) |\n| Cost of revenues | $133,332 | $126,203 | +$7,129 (+5.6%) |\n| Gross profit | $174,062 | $156,633 | +$17,429 (+11.1%) |\n| R&D expense | $45,427 | $39,500 | +$5,927 (+15.0%) |\n| Operating income | $84,293 | $74,842 | +$9,451 (+12.6%) |\n| Net income | $73,795 | $59,972 | +$13,823 (+23.1%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 56.6% | 55.4% | +1.2% (improved) |\n| Operating margin | 27.4% | 26.5% | +0.9% (improved) |\n| Net profit margin | 24.0% | 21.2% | +2.8% (improved) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ❌ **NO**\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 15.0% ($5,927M)\n- ❌ All profit margins IMPROVED:\n  - Gross margin: +1.2%\n  - Operating margin: +0.9%\n  - Net profit margin: +2.8%\n\n**Analysis:**\nAlphabet increased R&D spending by 15.0% (the highest percentage increase among companies analyzed) while simultaneously improving all profit margins. Revenue grew 8.7%, but costs grew slower (+5.6%), resulting in expanding gross margin. Despite the significant R&D investment increase, operating and net margins both improved substantially.\n\n**Key Insight:** Like Microsoft, Alphabet demonstrates strong operational leverage - the company invested heavily in R&D (likely AI and cloud infrastructure) while improving profitability. Net income grew 23.1%, significantly faster than revenue growth (8.7%), showing excellent operational efficiency.\n\n**Data Limitation:** This analysis uses 2022-2023 data from the 2023 10-K. The 2024 10-K (with 2023-2024 data) would typically be filed in late January/early February 2025.\n\n---\n\n#### Meta Platforms, Inc.\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** January 31, 2025\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended December 31, 2024\n- **CIK:** 0001326801\n- **Location:** Item 8 - Consolidated Statements of Income\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Total revenue | $164,501 | $134,902 | +$29,599 (+21.9%) |\n| Cost of revenue | $30,161 | $25,959 | +$4,202 (+16.2%) |\n| Gross profit | $134,340 | $108,943 | +$25,397 (+23.3%) |\n| R&D expense | $43,873 | $38,483 | +$5,390 (+14.0%) |\n| Operating income | $69,380 | $46,751 | +$22,629 (+48.4%) |\n| Net income | $62,360 | $39,098 | +$23,262 (+59.5%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 81.7% | 80.8% | +0.9% (improved) |\n| Operating margin | 42.2% | 34.7% | +7.5% (improved) |\n| Net profit margin | 37.9% | 29.0% | +8.9% (improved) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ❌ **NO**\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 14.0% ($5,390M)\n- ❌ All profit margins IMPROVED dramatically:\n  - Gross margin: +0.9%\n  - Operating margin: +7.5% (exceptional improvement)\n  - Net profit margin: +8.9% (exceptional improvement)\n\n**Analysis:**\nMeta increased R&D spending by 14.0% while simultaneously improving all profit margins by the largest amounts seen among all companies analyzed. The company demonstrated exceptional operational leverage, with revenue growing 21.9% - significantly faster than both cost of revenue (+16.2%) and R&D expense (+14.0%). Operating income grew 48.4% and net income surged 59.5%, resulting in massive margin expansion.\n\n**Key Insight:** Meta demonstrates the strongest operational leverage among all tech companies analyzed. Despite heavy R&D investment (likely in AI infrastructure, Llama models, and Reality Labs), the company's core advertising business scaled extremely efficiently. The operating margin improvement of +7.5 percentage points and net margin improvement of +8.9 percentage points are exceptional, showing that Meta's AI and efficiency initiatives (2023 \"Year of Efficiency\") are paying off significantly.\n\n---\n\n#### Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** January 31, 2025\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended December 31, 2024\n- **CIK:** 0001018724\n- **Location:** Item 8 - Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Total net sales | $637,959 | $574,785 | +$63,174 (+11.0%) |\n| Cost of sales | $326,288 | $304,739 | +$21,549 (+7.1%) |\n| Gross profit | $311,671 | $270,046 | +$41,625 (+15.4%) |\n| Technology and infrastructure | $88,544 | $85,622 | +$2,922 (+3.4%) |\n| Operating income | $68,593 | $36,852 | +$31,741 (+86.1%) |\n| Net income | $59,248 | $30,425 | +$28,823 (+94.7%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 48.8% | 47.0% | +1.8% (improved) |\n| Operating margin | 10.8% | 6.4% | +4.4% (improved) |\n| Net profit margin | 9.3% | 5.3% | +4.0% (improved) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ❌ **NO**\n- ✅ Technology and infrastructure (includes R&D) increased by 3.4% ($2,922M)\n- ❌ All profit margins IMPROVED significantly:\n  - Gross margin: +1.8%\n  - Operating margin: +4.4% (exceptional improvement)\n  - Net profit margin: +4.0% (exceptional improvement)\n\n**Analysis:**\nAmazon increased Technology and infrastructure spending by 3.4% while simultaneously improving all profit margins significantly. The company demonstrated strong operational leverage, with revenue growing 11.0% while net income nearly doubled (+94.7%). The operating margin improvement of +4.4 percentage points is particularly impressive, reflecting efficiencies across AWS and retail operations.\n\n**Key Insight:** Amazon demonstrates exceptional operational leverage similar to Meta. Despite ongoing investments in AWS infrastructure, AI development, and logistics network expansion, the company's scale and operational efficiency improvements are driving dramatic margin expansion. Net income grew almost twice as fast as revenue, showing the power of Amazon's platform economics at scale.\n\n**Note:** Amazon does not separately report R&D expense on its income statement. Instead, R&D is included within \"Technology and infrastructure\" costs along with AWS data center operations, server costs, and other infrastructure expenses.\n\n---\n\n#### NVIDIA Corporation\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** February 6, 2025\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended January 26, 2025 (Fiscal Year 2025)\n- **CIK:** 0001045810\n- **Location:** Consolidated Statements of Income\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | FY2025 | FY2024 | Change |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total revenue | $130,497 | $60,922 | +$69,575 (+114.2%) |\n| Cost of revenue | $32,639 | $16,621 | +$16,018 (+96.4%) |\n| Gross profit | $97,858 | $44,301 | +$53,557 (+120.9%) |\n| R&D expense | $12,914 | $8,675 | +$4,239 (+48.9%) |\n| Operating income | $81,453 | $32,972 | +$48,481 (+147.0%) |\n| Net income | $72,880 | $29,760 | +$43,120 (+144.9%) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | FY2025 | FY2024 | Change |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 75.0% | 72.7% | +2.3% (improved) |\n| Operating margin | 62.4% | 54.1% | +8.3% (improved) |\n| Net profit margin | 55.9% | 48.8% | +7.1% (improved) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ❌ **NO**\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 48.9% ($4,239M) - highest dollar increase\n- ❌ All profit margins IMPROVED dramatically:\n  - Gross margin: +2.3%\n  - Operating margin: +8.3% (exceptional improvement)\n  - Net profit margin: +7.1% (exceptional improvement)\n\n**Analysis:**\nNVIDIA more than doubled revenue (+114.2%) while increasing R&D spending by nearly 50%, yet simultaneously expanded all profit margins dramatically. The company demonstrated extraordinary operational leverage, with revenue growing 114% while net income grew 145%. The operating margin improvement of +8.3 percentage points is exceptional, reflecting the high-margin nature of their AI GPU products (H100, H200, etc.).\n\n**Key Insight:** NVIDIA demonstrates the most dramatic growth AND margin expansion of any company analyzed. The AI/data center boom drove unprecedented revenue growth, while their high-margin GPU products allowed exceptional profitability scaling. Despite massive R&D investments in next-generation chips (Blackwell, etc.), the company's gross margins actually improved due to strong pricing power and favorable product mix. This represents the strongest example of operational leverage in the entire tech sector.\n\n**Note:** NVIDIA uses a fiscal year ending in January. FY2025 = year ended January 26, 2025.\n\n\n\n#### Intel Corporation\n\n**Source:**\n- **10-K Filing Date:** February 26, 2025\n- **Fiscal Period:** Year ended December 28, 2024\n- **CIK:** 0000050863\n- **Location:** Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n**Key Financials (in millions):**\n\n| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|--------|------|------|--------|\n| Net revenue | $53,101 | $54,228 | -$1,127 (-2.1%) |\n| Cost of sales | $35,756 | $32,517 | +$3,239 (+10.0%) |\n| Gross margin | $17,345 | $21,711 | -$4,366 (-20.1%) |\n| R&D expense | $16,546 | $16,046 | +$500 (+3.1%) |\n| Operating income (loss) | -$11,678 | $93 | -$11,771 (massive decline) |\n| Net income (loss) | -$19,233 | $1,675 | -$20,908 (profit to loss) |\n\n**Calculated Margins:**\n\n| Margin Type | 2024 | 2023 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Gross margin | 32.7% | 40.0% | -7.3% (declined) |\n| Operating margin | -22.0% | 0.2% | -22.2% (catastrophic decline) |\n| Net profit margin | -36.2% | 3.1% | -39.3% (catastrophic decline) |\n\n**Meets Criteria?** ✅ **YES**\n- ✅ R&D spending increased by 3.1% ($500M)\n- ✅ ALL profit margins DECLINED catastrophically:\n  - Gross margin: -7.3 percentage points\n  - Operating margin: -22.2 percentage points (went deeply negative)\n  - Net profit margin: -39.3 percentage points (went from +3.1% to -36.2%)\n\n**Analysis:**\nIntel represents the most severe case of margin decline among all companies analyzed. The company went from a small profit ($1.7B) in 2023 to a massive $19.2 billion loss in 2024. Revenue declined 2.1% while cost of sales increased 10.0%, creating a devastating compression of gross margins. Combined with increased R&D spending, restructuring charges ($7.0B), and operational challenges, Intel posted catastrophic losses at all levels.\n\n**Key Insight:** Intel demonstrates the complete opposite of NVIDIA's story. While NVIDIA doubled revenue and expanded margins dramatically through AI GPU dominance, Intel lost revenue and posted catastrophic losses due to competitive pressures in both the AI chip market (losing to NVIDIA) and traditional CPU markets (facing intense competition from AMD). Intel's increased R&D spending (\u0006.5B, highest in absolute dollars among all companies) failed to translate into revenue growth or margin improvement, highlighting fundamental business model challenges. The company is undergoing a major restructuring while simultaneously trying to invest in next-generation chip manufacturing, creating a perfect storm of declining profitability.\n\n**Note:** Intel's restructuring charges of $7.0B in 2024 include workforce reductions, facility consolidations, and strategic repositioning efforts as the company attempts to regain competitiveness in both data center and consumer markets.\n\n---\n---\n\n### Methodology\n\n**Research Process:**\n1.
