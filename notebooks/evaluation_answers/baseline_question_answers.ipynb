    "**Short Answer:**\n",

    "Between Q1 and Q4 FY2024, Microsoft's revenue growth strategy evolved in three major ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI became a formal mission commitment** (not just a technology) with emphasis on responsible deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gaming was dramatically elevated** through the $75.4B Activision Blizzard acquisition, transforming Xbox from +13% to +50% revenue growth\n",

    "3. **Cloud acceleration intensified** with Azure growth increasing from 29% to 30%, while devices (-22% to -15%) showed continued strategic de-prioritization\n",
