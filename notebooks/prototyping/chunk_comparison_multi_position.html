The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) have conducted a preliminary investigation and evaluation of the site and have undertaken temporary remedial action in the nature of air-stripping towers.

The Company and the other PRPs have reached an agreement regarding the funding of groundwater monitoring and the operation of the air-strippers as required by the Unilateral Order. The Company was required to install and operate a soil vapor extraction system to remove TCE from the Company's property. As of February 1, 1994, the Company has installed and is operating the equipment pursuant to the Unilateral Order. In addition, the EPA and IDEM have asserted a claim for reimbursement of their investigatory costs and the costs of installing and operating the air-strippers on the municipal well field (the EPA Costs). On February 22, 1993, the United States filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana against eight of the PRPs, including the Company. On July 20, 1993, IDEM joined in the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks recovery of the costs of enforcement, prejudgment interest and an amount in excess of 6.8 million, which represents costs incurred to date by the EPA and IDEM, and a declaration that the eight defendant PRPs are liable for any future costs incurred by the EPA and IDEM in connection with the site. The Company does not believe the annual cost to the Company of monitoring groundwater and operating the soil vapor extraction system and the air-strippers will be material. Each of the PRPs, including the Company, is jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the EPA Costs. Certain PRPs, including the Company, are currently attempting to negotiate an agreed upon allocation of such liability. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been recorded for its costs and its anticipated share of EPA Costs and that its cash on hand, unused lines of credit or cash from operations are sufficient to fund any required expenditures. The EPA has also named the Company as a PRP for costs at three other disposal sites. The Company believes it has recorded adequate provisions for...</div>
