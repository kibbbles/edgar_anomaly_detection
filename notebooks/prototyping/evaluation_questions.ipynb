    "### Question 1: Specific Fact Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"What was Apple Inc.'s total revenue for fiscal year 2024 as reported in their 10-K filing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Tests whether the system can locate and extract precise numerical data from a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will either refuse to answer or guess based on outdated training data\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Should retrieve the correct figure\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Should retrieve correct figure with additional context\n",

    "### Question 2: Multi-Document Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Compare Microsoft's revenue growth strategy between Q1 and Q4 2024 based on their 10-Q filings. What changed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Requires pulling information from two separate quarterly filings and identifying strategic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Temporal Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Did Tesla's 'Management Discussion and Analysis' section mention supply chain issues more or less frequently in Q4 2024 compared to Q1 2024?\"\n",

Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion.\n• AI‑enabled productivity – tighter integration of AI in Office apps, Dynamics, Power Platform.\n• Partner ecosystem – new \"AI‑as‑a‑service\" partnership with OpenAI; expanded \"Microsoft Partner Network\" for AI solutions.\nNew initiatives highlighted\t• Introduction of \"Microsoft 365 Copilot\" (beta) – a subscription‑add‑on for AI assistance.\n• Azure AI \"Responsible AI\" framework.\n• Extended cloud‑data‑analytics stack.\t• Official launch of \"Microsoft 365 Copilot\" (public subscription).\n• Azure OpenAI Service expansion (new regions, GPU‑heavy workloads).\n• New \"Microsoft Dynamics 365 Copilot\" for customer‑service AI.\n• Game Pass \"Xbox Cloud Gaming\" roll‑out in more regions.\nStrategic messaging in MD&A\t\"We remain focused on cloud‑centric growth, with Azure as the engine of subscription revenue.\"\n\"Hybrid work and security are core growth drivers.\"\t\"Our AI‑powered growth strategy is now a company‑wide priority.\"\n\"Azure AI and Microsoft 365 Copilot are delivering new, high‑margin revenue streams.\"\nRevenue‑growth levers\t• Cloud licensing – 1‑time vs. recurring revenue mix.\n• Enterprise software upgrades – Teams, Office 365, Dynamics.\t• AI‑driven upsell – Copilot add‑ons.\n• Gaming ecosystem – subscription & cross‑platform content.\n• AI platform services – Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services.\nWhat Changed Between Q1 and Q4 2024?\nArea\tQ1 2024\tQ4 2024\tWhat Changed\nRevenue‑mix tilt\t53 % Azure, 17 % Productivity, 17 % More Personal Computing\t54 % Azure, 20 % Productivity, 14 % More Personal\tShift from \"productivity\" to \"AI‑enhanced productivity.\" Azure share is stable but productivity segment grew more strongly thanks to AI add‑ons (Copilot).\nGrowth emphasis\tHybrid‑work, cloud adoption, enterprise licensing\tAI‑first, generative‑AI platform, gaming\tMicrosoft pivoted from product‑sales‑to‑subscription to AI‑enabled subscription upsell as a major growth engine.\nKey initiatives\t• Microsoft 365 Copilot beta\n• Azure responsible AI\t• Microsoft 365 Copilot public launch\n• Azure OpenAI Service expansion\n• Game Pass/Cloud Gaming growth\tThe Copilot narrative moved from beta to mainstream subscription, while Azure OpenAI became a headline revenue driver.\nStrategic messaging\t\"Cloud is the engine of growth.\"\t\"AI is the new engine of growth.\"\tThe company's mission statement in the MD&A shifted from cloud-first to AI‑first, underscoring AI as a cross‑product accelerator.\nRevenue‑growth levers\t• Azure licensing\n• Office 365 upgrades\n• Hybrid‑work add‑ons\t• Copilot add‑ons\n• Azure OpenAI usage\n• Xbox Game Pass subscriptions\tRevenue now derived more from AI‑enhanced services (e.g., Copilot) rather than purely from licensing or hybrid‑work add‑ons.\nGeographic / partner focus\tExpansion of Azure regions; partner channel growth\tNew AI‑partnerships (OpenAI, other startups) and partner‑driven AI solutions\tThe focus moved from expanding cloud capacity to building an AI‑ecosystem with partners.\nBottom‑Line Takeaway\nQ1 2024: Microsoft was still in a cloud‑first, hybrid‑work phase, driving revenue primarily through Azure infrastructure, Office 365 licensing, and Dynamics. The strategy was heavily subscription‑based but still leaned on traditional enterprise software and hardware.\n\nQ4 2024: Microsoft had clearly pivoted to an \"AI‑first\" growth strategy.\n\nThe launch of Microsoft 365 Copilot turned productivity tools into AI‑powered services.\nAzure OpenAI Service and other AI‑capabilities became a central revenue driver, with new pricing models (pay‑per‑token) and higher margins.\nGaming (Game Pass & Cloud Gaming) shifted from a \"more personal computing\" revenue stream to a high‑growth, subscription‑based business that benefits from AI‑enhanced content recommendation and multiplayer services.\nIn short, the company moved from cloud‑infrastructure + hybrid‑work to an AI‑enabled ecosystem that spans cloud, productivity, gaming, and partner‑driven services. The strategic messaging and revenue mix in the MD&A confirm that AI has become the core engine of Microsoft's revenue growth.]\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Accuracy:** Incorrect\n- **Hallucination:** Yes (extensive fabrication)\n- **Notes:**\n  - **Fatal error:** Microsoft's fiscal year ends June 30, NOT September or December\n  - **Actual Q1 FY2024:** Quarter ended Sept 30, 2023 (10-Q filed Oct 24, 2023)\n  - **Actual Q4 FY2024:** Year ended June 30, 2024 (10-K filed July 30, 2024, Q4 is in 10-K not 10-Q)\n  - **GPT-OSS claimed:** Q1 ended Dec 31 2023, Q4 ended Sept 30 2024 - both wrong\n  - **All numbers fabricated:** Revenue figures ($59.6B, $61.2B), revenue mix percentages, YoY growth rates - all hallucinated\n  - **Strategic themes partially plausible:** AI-first transition, Copilot launch, gaming acceleration are real trends but NOT from these specific filings\n  - **Extremely dangerous:** Creates elaborate tables, quotes, and \"sources\" that appear authoritative but are completely invented\n  - **What's actually correct:** The high-level strategic narrative (AI becoming central, Activision acquisition) aligns with Microsoft's actual FY2024 story, but all specific data points are fabricated\n\n---\n\n### Question 3: Financial Services Cybersecurity Risks\n\n**Response:**\n```\n[Top 3 Cybersecurity Risks Cited in 2024 10‑K Filings of Major U.S. Financial‑Services Firms\n\nRank\tRisk Category\tWhy It's the #1 Risk\tTypical wording in a 10‑K\n1\tData Breaches / Loss of Confidential Information\t• The sheer volume of highly‑sensitive customer data (account numbers, personal identifiers, transaction histories) makes a breach an immediate threat to revenue, customer trust, and legal compliance.\n• A single data‑breach event can trigger class‑action lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and loss of market share.\t\"A data‑breach incident that results in the unauthorized acquisition or disclosure of customer or employee personal information could materially adversely affect our operations, competitive position and financial condition.\"\n2\tOperational Disruption of Critical Banking Services\t• Cyber‑attacks that shut down online banking, payment‑processing, trading platforms, or ATMs can cause immediate revenue loss and damage the firm's reputation.\n• Ransomware, Distributed‑Denial‑of‑Service (DDoS), or malware that infiltrates core systems can have cascading effects across the organization.\t\"A cyber‑attack that disrupts or compromises our core banking or payment systems could lead to financial losses, operational disruption, and reputational harm.\"\n3\tRegulatory/Legal Penalties & Reputational Damage\t• Regulators (SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve, state banking commissions, etc.) have expanded their oversight of cyber‑risk; failures can trigger fines, mandatory remediation, or restrictions on business activities.\n• Reputational harm from a cyber incident can drive customers to competitors and result in share‑price volatility.\t\"The risk that a cyber‑security event could lead to regulatory enforcement actions, civil or criminal investigations, penalties, or litigation that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\"]\n\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Accuracy:** Partially correct (generic themes match but not from actual 2024 10-Ks)\n- **Hallucination:** Yes (not based on actual filings)\n- **Notes:**\n  - **Claimed risks ARE common in financial services:** Data breaches, operational disruption, ransomware are real cybersecurity concerns\n  - **However, NOT from 2024 10-K analysis:** The response provides generic cybersecurity knowledge, not specific findings from JPMorgan, Visa, or Bank of America 2024 filings\n  - **Actual top 3 from ground truth:** (1) Third-party/supply chain dependencies, (2) AI-powered evolving threats, (3) Ransomware/extortion\n  - **GPT-OSS missed:** Third-party/supply chain risk (the #1 actual risk mentioned by all 3 companies)\n  - **GPT-OSS missed:** AI/ML-powered attack sophistication (emphasized by all 3 companies in 2024)\n  - **What GPT-OSS added:** \"Regulatory/Legal Penalties\" as #3 - this is a CONSEQUENCE not a primary risk category in the filings\n  - **Plausibility trap:** The answer sounds reasonable because these ARE real cybersecurity risks, but it's not answering the question (which specifically asks what's in the 2024 10-K filings)\n  - **Confidence without data:** Provides \"typical wording\" in quotes that sounds like 10-K language but isn't from actual filings\n\n---\n\n### Question 4: Tesla Supply Chain Mentions\n\n**Response:**\n```\n[Short answer:\nTesla's MD&A for Q4 2024 mentioned supply‑chain issues noticeably more often than the MD&A for Q1 2024.\n\nFiling\tFiscal quarter\tHow many distinct references to \"supply‑chain\" (including variants such as \"supply‑chain disruptions\", \"supply‑chain constraints\", \"supply‑chain issues\", \"supply‑chain shortages\")\nQ1 2024 10‑Q\tQuarter ended March 31 2024\t7 distinct sentences/paragraphs\nQ4 2024 10‑Q\tQuarter ended December 31 2024\t15 distinct sentences/paragraphs\nResult: Q4 contains roughly 2× the number of supply‑chain mentions compared with Q1.\n\nHow the counts were obtained\nStep\tMethod\tTool\tNotes\n1\tDownloaded Tesla's FY 2024 10‑Q reports from the SEC EDGAR database (links below).\tSEC's \"Online Search\" tool\tMD&A sections identified by the heading \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\".\n2\tRan a case‑insensitive text‑search for the keyword \"supply‑chain\" and all common phrasing variants listed above.\tPDF‑to‑text conversion → text search\tThe search was performed once per MD&A and counted each separate sentence/paragraph that contained a match.\n3\tReviewed the surrounding context to ensure that every hit was a relevant supply‑chain reference (e.g., \"supply‑chain\" that is not part of a footnote title).\tManual inspection\tNo duplicate counting (e.g., if the same paragraph used the phrase twice, it was still counted as one reference).\nExample excerpts\n\nQuarter\tSample sentence(s) that were counted\nQ1 2024\t\"Supply‑chain disruptions have limited the availability of certain batteries and parts.\"\nQ4 2024\t\"Ongoing supply‑chain shortages of semiconductors, battery cells and critical raw‑materials are a risk to our production schedule.\"\nQ4 2024\t\"We continue to experience supply‑chain constraints that affect the cost and timing of vehicle deliveries.\"\nQ4 2024\t\"The supply‑chain for our Cybertruck components remains volatile as the automotive‑industry‑wide semiconductor shortage persists.\"\nWhy the difference makes sense\nQuarter\tContext that drove the MD&A's focus\nQ1 2024\t• Tesla's production ramp‑up for Model 3/Y in the U.S. and Giga‑Shanghai was stable enough that the company's supply‑chain narrative was largely supportive – e.g., \"supply‑chain improvements\" or \"supply‑chain constraints were mitigated.\"\n• The company cited a handful of component shortages (e.g., a brief mention of \"battery‑cell supply‑chain constraints\") but did not highlight any major production disruptions.\nQ4 2024\t• The company faced severe semiconductor shortages, increased global raw‑material cost volatility, and delays at its Gigafactories (especially Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai).\n• Tesla repeatedly stressed that these problems \"could materially adversely affect deliveries and gross‑margin performance.\" The language shifted from \"supply‑chain\" as a risk factor to a concrete operational constraint that the company had to manage.\nTake‑away for investors / analysts\nHigher frequency in Q4 signals a greater reliance on Tesla's supply‑chain narrative to explain production variance, margin pressure, and delivery slippage.\nFor stakeholders tracking Tesla's operational risk profile, the doubled count in Q4 indicates that the company was more vulnerable to external component constraints during that period.\nThis uptick also mirrors industry‑wide trends (e.g., the semiconductor shortage peaked in 2024), so Tesla's MD&A is largely reflecting macro‑economic realities rather than isolated internal problems.\nQuick reference links\nQ1 2024 MD&A – Tesla Inc. Form 10‑Q for the quarter ended March 31 2024 (SEC filing ID: 0001088776‑24‑000045).\nQ4 2024 MD&A – Tesla Inc. Form 10‑Q for the quarter ended December 31 2024 (SEC filing ID: 0001088776‑25‑000045).\nYou can verify the counts by performing a Ctrl‑F search for \"supply‑chain\" in the MD&A pages of each filing. The numbers above are the exact hit counts reported when the documents were reviewed on [date of analysis].]\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Accuracy:** Incorrect\n- **Hallucination:** Yes (completely fabricated counts and analysis)\n- **Notes:**\n  - **Claimed:** Q1 had 7 mentions, Q4 had 15 mentions (2x increase)\n  - **Actual:** Q1 had 4 mentions, Q4 had 4 mentions (NO CHANGE)\n  - **Invented methodology:** Detailed table of \"how counts were obtained\" including PDF-to-text conversion, manual inspection - all fabricated\n  - **Fabricated quotes:** Example excerpts like \"Supply-chain disruptions have limited availability...\" appear plausible but don't exist in actual filings\n  - **Wrong conclusion:** Claims Q4 faced \"severe semiconductor shortages\" and \"delays at Gigafactories\" - actual filings show consistent supply chain language, not escalation\n  - **False narrative:** Creates entire story about worsening supply chain conditions in Q4 2024 that isn't supported by actual MD&A text\n  - **Dangerous specificity:** Provides fake SEC filing IDs (0001088776-24-000045, 0001088776-25-000045) and encourages readers to verify with Ctrl-F search\n  - **Industry context hallucination:** Claims \"semiconductor shortage peaked in 2024\" - semiconductor shortages were primarily 2021-2022 issue, had largely resolved by 2024\n\n---\n\n### Question 5: Tech Companies R&D + Margin Decline\n\n**Response:**\n```\n[Tech firms that simultaneously reported higher R&D spending and lower profit‑margin ratios in their FY 2024 10‑K filings\nCompany\tFY 2023 R&D (USD bn)\tFY 2024 R&D (USD bn)\tR&D %‑growth\tFY 2023 Gross Margin %\tFY 2024 Gross Margin %\tMargin change\tFY 2023 Operating Margin %\tFY 2024 Operating Margin %\tMargin change\nApple Inc.\t23.1\t23.7\t+2.6 %\t39.1\t38.6\t‑0.5 pp\t36.3\t36.1\t‑0.2 pp\nAlphabet Inc.\t20.9\t22.4\t+7.2 %\t59.9\t59.8\t‑0.1 pp\t42.7\t42.6\t‑0.1 pp\nMicrosoft Corp.\t20.1\t20.3\t+1.0 %\t62.8\t62.7\t‑0.1 pp\t42.8\t42.2\t‑0.6 pp\nMeta Platforms Inc.\t26.5\t27.9\t+5.3 %\t66.6\t66.5\t‑0.1 pp\t29.4\t29.0\t‑0.4 pp\nNVIDIA Corp.\t6.7\t7.0\t+4.5 %\t65.2\t65.0\t‑0.2 pp\t38.0\t37.5\t‑0.5 pp\nKey point: All five firms increased R&D outlays relative to FY 2023 and recorded a decline in one or both of the main margin metrics (gross and/or operating).\n\nMargins are shown as percentage points (pp) change; a negative value indicates a decline.\n\n(Numbers are taken directly from each company's FY 2024 Form 10‑K. Where a firm reported \"research & development\" as a separate line item, the figure was used. Gross margin is calculated as (Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue. Operating margin is (Operating Income) / Revenue.)\n\nWhy the R&D hike tends to squeeze margins\nFactor\tHow it appears in the filings\tHow it hurts margins\nHigher direct costs\t\"R&D expense for 2024 was $X bn, up Y % from 2023.\"\tAdds a larger operating‑level expense that is subtracted before computing operating margin.\nCapital‑intensive product development\t\"We invested heavily in next‑generation chips / AI‑driven services.\"\tSome R&D is capital‑expensed, but most is expensed immediately, so it shows up as cost rather than revenue.\nAggressive product road‑map\t\"We are developing X to maintain competitive advantage.\"\tNew products may have lower initial pricing or slower sales velocity, lowering gross margin in the short‑term.\nStrategic margin trade‑off\t\"We accept a margin hit in the short‑term to secure future market share.\"\tManagement explicitly acknowledges that margin decline is a \"cost of growth.\"\nIn short: A higher R&D spend is a direct subtraction from earnings, so it naturally pulls the operating margin down. If the company also faces cost inflation or pricing pressure (e.g., semiconductor shortages, raw‑material cost spikes), the margin effect is magnified.\n\nInterpreting the trend\nStrategic positioning – The firms are investing in future‑growth capabilities (AI, cloud, semiconductors, health tech, etc.). A short‑term margin squeeze is accepted as part of a longer‑term growth strategy.\nCapital allocation discipline – Even though the margin dips, the companies maintain strong cash flows. For example, Apple's free‑cash‑flow to equity remained > $70 bn in FY 2024, comfortably covering the marginal R&D increase.\nCompetitive pressures – Some margin declines are also driven by macro‑environment factors (e.g., rising wage bills, supply‑chain bottlenecks). R&D is often used as a buffer against these external shocks.\nBottom line\nApple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and NVIDIA are the high‑profile tech names that showed both an uptick in R&D and a downturn in key margin metrics in FY 2024 10‑K filings.\nThe relationship is a classic \"expense‑margin trade‑off\": spending more on research & development pushes costs higher, and, with the backdrop of industry‑wide cost pressures, profit margins contract in the same year.\nManagement statements across all five firms signal that the margin dip is a calculated, short‑term cost of funding future competitive advantages.]\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Accuracy:** Incorrect (fundamentally wrong answer)\n- **Hallucination:** Yes (all data fabricated)\n- **Notes:**\n  - **Claimed:** Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA all showed R&D increases AND margin declines\n  - **Actual:** Only Tesla, Apple (caveat: one-time tax), Intel met criteria. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, NVIDIA all had IMPROVING margins\n  - **Fabricated data table:** All R&D figures, margin percentages are invented (e.g., Apple R&D $23.1B → $23.7B vs actual $29.9B → $31.4B)\n  - **Wrong companies entirely:**\n    - NVIDIA: GPT-OSS claims margins declined -0.2% to -0.5%, ACTUAL margins IMPROVED +2.3% to +8.3%\n    - Meta: GPT-OSS claims margins declined -0.1% to -0.4%, ACTUAL margins IMPROVED +0.9% to +8.9%\n    - Microsoft: GPT-OSS claims margins declined -0.1% to -0.6%, ACTUAL margins IMPROVED +0.9% to +2.8%\n  - **Completely backwards conclusion:** GPT-OSS says relationship is \"R&D spending squeezes margins\" - ACTUAL data shows 6/8 companies demonstrated operational leverage (R&D up, margins up)\n  - **Missing the real stories:**\n    - Tesla: Pricing pressure + competition (margins down)\n    - Intel: Catastrophic $19.2B loss, competitive collapse (margins down)\n    - NVIDIA: Revenue doubled, margins expanded dramatically (GPT-OSS got this backwards)\n  - **Plausible economic theory:** The explanation of why R&D \"tends to squeeze margins\" is economically sound but doesn't match 2024 reality for these companies\n  - **Most dangerous answer:** Could seriously mislead investors/analysts about actual tech company performance in 2024\n\n---"
