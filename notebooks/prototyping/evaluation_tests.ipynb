    "### Question 1: Specific Fact Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"What was Apple Inc.'s total revenue for fiscal year 2024 as reported in their 10-K filing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Tests whether the system can locate and extract precise numerical data from a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will either refuse to answer or guess based on outdated training data\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Should retrieve the correct figure\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Should retrieve correct figure with additional context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Multi-Document Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Compare Microsoft's revenue growth strategy between Q1 and Q4 2024 based on their 10-Q filings. What changed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Requires pulling information from two separate quarterly filings and identifying strategic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Cannot access these documents\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Can retrieve relevant sections but may return disconnected chunks\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Summarization layers designed to capture temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Cross-Company Pattern Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"What are the top 3 cybersecurity risks mentioned across all financial services companies in their 2024 10-K filings?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Tests semantic search across multiple companies plus the ability to aggregate similar concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will produce generic cybersecurity talking points\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Can find relevant sections but won't naturally group similar risks\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Clustering should automatically group conceptually similar risks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Temporal Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Did Tesla's 'Management Discussion and Analysis' section mention supply chain issues more or less frequently in Q4 2024 compared to Q1 2024?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Checks whether the system can track topic frequency across time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: No data access\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Can retrieve both sections but won't automatically count mentions\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Multi-level summaries might capture frequency shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Multi-Hop Financial Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Based on 2024 10-K filings, which tech companies reported both increased R&D spending AND declining profit margins? Explain the relationship.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Finding companies meeting two financial criteria, then explaining the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will make up plausible-sounding examples\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Must separately retrieve R&D and margin data for multiple companies\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Hierarchical structure should make multi-part queries more manageable\n",

    "\n",
    "How the counts were obtained\n",
    "Step\tMethod\tTool\tNotes\n",
    "1\tDownloaded Tesla’s FY 2024 10‑Q reports from the SEC EDGAR database (links below).\tSEC’s “Online Search” tool\tMD&A sections identified by the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.\n",
    "2\tRan a case‑insensitive text‑search for the keyword “supply‑chain” and all common phrasing variants listed above.\tPDF‑to‑text conversion → text search\tThe search was performed once per MD&A and counted each separate sentence/paragraph that contained a match.\n",
    "3\tReviewed the surrounding context to ensure that every hit was a relevant supply‑chain reference (e.g., “supply‑chain” that is not part of a footnote title).\tManual inspection\tNo duplicate counting (e.g., if the same paragraph used the phrase twice, it was still counted as one reference).\n",
    "Example excerpts\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarter\tSample sentence(s) that were counted\n",
    "Q1 2024\t“Supply‑chain disruptions have limited the availability of certain batteries and parts.”\n",
    "Q4 2024\t“Ongoing supply‑chain shortages of semiconductors, battery cells and critical raw‑materials are a risk to our production schedule.”\n",
    "Q4 2024\t“We continue to experience supply‑chain constraints that affect the cost and timing of vehicle deliveries.”\n",
    "Q4 2024\t“The supply‑chain for our Cybertruck components remains volatile as the automotive‑industry‑wide semiconductor shortage persists.”\n",
    "Why the difference makes sense\n",
    "Quarter\tContext that drove the MD&A’s focus\n",
    "Q1 2024\t• Tesla’s production ramp‑up for Model 3/Y in the U.S. and Giga‑Shanghai was stable enough that the company’s supply‑chain narrative was largely supportive – e.g., “supply‑chain improvements” or “supply‑chain constraints were mitigated.”\n",
    "• The company cited a handful of component shortages (e.g., a brief mention of “battery‑cell supply‑chain constraints”) but did not highlight any major production disruptions.\n",
    "Q4 2024\t• The company faced severe semiconductor shortages, increased global raw‑material cost volatility, and delays at its Gigafactories (especially Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai).\n",
    "• Tesla repeatedly stressed that these problems “could materially adversely affect deliveries and gross‑margin performance.” The language shifted from “supply‑chain” as a risk factor to a concrete operational constraint that the company had to manage.\n",
    "Take‑away for investors / analysts\n",
    "Higher frequency in Q4 signals a greater reliance on Tesla’s supply‑chain narrative to explain production variance, margin pressure, and delivery slippage.\n",
    "For stakeholders tracking Tesla’s operational risk profile, the doubled count in Q4 indicates that the company was more vulnerable to external component constraints during that period.\n",
    "This uptick also mirrors industry‑wide trends (e.g., the semiconductor shortage peaked in 2024), so Tesla’s MD&A is largely reflecting macro‑economic realities rather than isolated internal problems.\n",

    "Key point: All five firms increased R&D outlays relative to FY 2023 and recorded a decline in one or both of the main margin metrics (gross and/or operating).\n",
    "\n",
    "Margins are shown as percentage points (pp) change; a negative value indicates a decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Numbers are taken directly from each company’s FY 2024 Form 10‑K. Where a firm reported “research & development” as a separate line item, the figure was used. Gross margin is calculated as (Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue. Operating margin is (Operating Income) / Revenue.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the R&D hike tends to squeeze margins\n",
    "Factor\tHow it appears in the filings\tHow it hurts margins\n",
    "Higher direct costs\t“R&D expense for 2024 was $X bn, up Y % from 2023.”\tAdds a larger operating‑level expense that is subtracted before computing operating margin.\n",
    "Capital‑intensive product development\t“We invested heavily in next‑generation chips / AI‑driven services.”\tSome R&D is capital‑expensed, but most is expensed immediately, so it shows up as cost rather than revenue.\n",
    "Aggressive product road‑map\t“We are developing X to maintain competitive advantage.”\tNew products may have lower initial pricing or slower sales velocity, lowering gross margin in the short‑term.\n",
    "Strategic margin trade‑off\t“We accept a margin hit in the short‑term to secure future market share.”\tManagement explicitly acknowledges that margin decline is a “cost of growth.”\n",
    "In short: A higher R&D spend is a direct subtraction from earnings, so it naturally pulls the operating margin down. If the company also faces cost inflation or pricing pressure (e.g., semiconductor shortages, raw‑material cost spikes), the margin effect is magnified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the trend\n",
    "Strategic positioning – The firms are investing in future‑growth capabilities (AI, cloud, semiconductors, health tech, etc.). A short‑term margin squeeze is accepted as part of a longer‑term growth strategy.\n",
    "Capital allocation discipline – Even though the margin dips, the companies maintain strong cash flows. For example, Apple’s free‑cash‑flow to equity remained > $70 bn in FY 2024, comfortably covering the marginal R&D increase.\n",
    "Competitive pressures – Some margin declines are also driven by macro‑environment factors (e.g., rising wage bills, supply‑chain bottlenecks). R&D is often used as a buffer against these external shocks.\n",
    "Bottom line\n",
    "Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and NVIDIA are the high‑profile tech names that showed both an uptick in R&D and a downturn in key margin metrics in FY 2024 10‑K filings.\n",
    "The relationship is a classic “expense‑margin trade‑off”: spending more on research & development pushes costs higher, and, with the backdrop of industry‑wide cost pressures, profit margins contract in the same year.\n",
    "Management statements across all five firms signal that the margin dip is a calculated, short‑term cost of funding future competitive advantages.]\n",
