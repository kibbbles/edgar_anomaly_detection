    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook contains standardized test questions for evaluating different system configurations:\n",
    "- **Baseline (No RAG)**: Base LLM without access to SEC filing data\n",
    "- **Simple RAG**: Traditional vector similarity retrieval\n",
    "- **RAPTOR RAG**: Hierarchical clustering with recursive summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Approach\n",
    "Each question tests different capabilities:\n",
    "1. Specific fact retrieval from single documents\n",
    "2. Multi-document synthesis and comparison\n",
    "3. Cross-company pattern recognition\n",
    "4. Temporal frequency analysis\n",
    "5. Multi-hop financial reasoning\n",

    "## Test Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Specific Fact Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"What was Apple Inc.'s total revenue for fiscal year 2024 as reported in their 10-K filing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Tests whether the system can locate and extract precise numerical data from a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will either refuse to answer or guess based on outdated training data\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Should retrieve the correct figure\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Should retrieve correct figure with additional context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Multi-Document Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Compare Microsoft's revenue growth strategy between Q1 and Q4 2024 based on their 10-Q filings. What changed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Requires pulling information from two separate quarterly filings and identifying strategic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Cannot access these documents\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Can retrieve relevant sections but may return disconnected chunks\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Summarization layers designed to capture temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Cross-Company Pattern Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"What are the top 3 cybersecurity risks mentioned across all financial services companies in their 2024 10-K filings?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Tests semantic search across multiple companies plus the ability to aggregate similar concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will produce generic cybersecurity talking points\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Can find relevant sections but won't naturally group similar risks\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Clustering should automatically group conceptually similar risks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Temporal Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Did Tesla's 'Management Discussion and Analysis' section mention supply chain issues more or less frequently in Q4 2024 compared to Q1 2024?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Checks whether the system can track topic frequency across time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: No data access\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Can retrieve both sections but won't automatically count mentions\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Multi-level summaries might capture frequency shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Multi-Hop Financial Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "> \"Based on 2024 10-K filings, which tech companies reported both increased R&D spending AND declining profit margins? Explain the relationship.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Finding companies meeting two financial criteria, then explaining the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior:**\n",
    "- Baseline: Will make up plausible-sounding examples\n",
    "- Simple RAG: Must separately retrieve R&D and margin data for multiple companies\n",
    "- RAPTOR RAG: Hierarchical structure should make multi-part queries more manageable\n",

    "1. Run baseline tests first (no RAG) to establish performance floor\n",
    "2. Complete embedding generation (in progress)\n",
    "3. Set up ChromaDB with 2024 filing embeddings\n",
    "4. Run Simple RAG tests\n",
    "5. Implement RAPTOR clustering and summarization\n",
    "6. Run RAPTOR RAG tests\n",
    "7. Apply RAGAS evaluation framework\n",
    "8. Conduct human evaluation (2 analysts)\n",

    "To add a new model for testing:\n",
    "1. Add a new section under each test configuration (Baseline, Simple RAG, RAPTOR RAG)\n",
